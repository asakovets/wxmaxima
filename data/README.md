# Data

This directory contains the following things

## Desktop integration files

Stuff needed for to integrate wxMaxima into various desktop environments.

## Icons that are compiled into the executable

Like wxMathml.lisp the icons aren't shipped as separate files along with
wxMaxima. Instead `generate_pngs.sh` generates .h files that contain the
images and that are compiled into wxMaxima.
