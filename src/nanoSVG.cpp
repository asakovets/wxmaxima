/*! \file
  This file instantiates nanoSVG, except the case wxWidgets does do so. If it
  fails to do this we get linker errors wrt nanoSVG after compilation.

#include <wx/wx.h>

/* The nanosvg .h files contain both the header and the implementation.
   In exactly one file of the project need to be defined in order to
   make the implementation visible to the compiler.

   In wxWidgets >3.1.6 this is done in wxWidgets itself so we need to
   skip that step there.

   So that should work. But for Linux builds with 3.1.6 I get linking errors,
   e.g.: undefined reference to `nsvgRasterize' Therefore do not define
   NANOSVG_IMPLEMENTATION/NANOSVGRAST_IMPLEMENTATION only for Windows. That is
   probably not correct (a FIXME), but I have no idea, why Linux still requires
   that NANOSVG_IMPLEMENTATION/NANOSVGRAST_IMPLEMENTATION is defined.
